Docker is the worldâ€™s most popular container engine, so we will focus our discussion of container image architecture on Docker.

A Docker image is a collection of files, including binaries, source code and other dependencies, needed to deploy a container environment. In Docker, there are two ways to create an images:

  * **Create an image from an existing container** - you can run a container from an existing image, modify the container environment, and save the result as a  new image.

  * **Dockerfile** - Docker provides a simple, human-readable configuration file that specifies what a Docker image should contain.
