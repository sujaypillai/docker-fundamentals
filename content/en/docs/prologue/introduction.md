### Creating Containers from Scratch
{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="If you'd like to see how containers are built from scratch, Liz Rice from Isovalent has a fantastic talk in which she creates a container from scratch in Go. While she makes a simple container, this talk doesn't go into networking, using images for the filesystem, and more. But, it gives a _fantastic_ deep dive into how things are working." />}}
